An ergonomic library for writing [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) build files,
similar to [ninja-syntax](https://lib.rs/crates/ninja_syntax)
and [ninja-build-syntax](https://github.com/fbenkstein/ninja-build-syntax)

## Why another?
I found existing libraries poorly documented, and I want to explore
and learn the syntax for ninja myself.

## Usage
See [documentation](https://docs.rs/ninja-writer).

## Contribution and issues
