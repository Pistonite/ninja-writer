Library for writing [ninja](https://ninja-build.org) build files with a focus on
ergonomics and simplicity.

## Why another?
I found existing libraries poorly documented, and I want to explore
and learn the syntax for ninja myself.

## Usage
See [documentation](https://docs.rs/ninja-writer).

## Contribution
Contributions are welcomed. Please open issues and PRs :)
